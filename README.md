## Recoup Technical Assessment

### MongoDB
I used the free tier on MongoDB for the database.

### Node.js
I used node with express for the server. It is connected with the mongo database and runs on port 3000.

### React Native
I used React Native and built the frontend for iOS. I integrated Firebase Auth to handle users signing up and logging in and out.

Users can sign in with a unique username and email. The email is then used for login. Users can start chats with existing users and continue chats that are already open.
